I like Python.  I like Ruby.  I like C, C++, and Objective-C.  I like Java.  I also (actually) like PHP.  I like programming - get it?  Use whatever gets the job done and done well.  Use whatever achieves the performance and scalability you require for a given task.  Use what makes sense given a specific problem's domain.  <del>Use whatever aligns itself with the way your mind works</del>.  Don't be a one trick pony (that isn't a Django reference).  Learn multiple languages, their strengths, and their weaknesses.  Understand when a language's strengths will allow you to solve a problem faster, easier, better.  Don't force a square peg through a round hole.

Watch **[this](http://www.itworld.com/video?bcpid=1578108607&bclid=1588003312&bctid=23220283001)** video.  It's excellent food for thought and drives home the importance, as a programmer, of learning new, different, languages to expand your ability to solve problems in a variety of ways.  The video mentions the [Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir%E2%80%93Whorf_hypothesis) which suggests that a particular language influences how a person understands and interacts with the world.  This makes a lot of sense.

**A programmer who thinks only in terms of a single language will attempt to solve every problem with that language.  You need more than one tool on your belt because not every problem is a nail.**
