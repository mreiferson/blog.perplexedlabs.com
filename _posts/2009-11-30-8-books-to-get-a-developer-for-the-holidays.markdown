### [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&tag=perplabs-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735619670)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perplabs-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0735619670)



Another classic "software construction" book.  Sharpen your saw with timeless information that can be applied to any project in any language.  Less bugs, more productivity, more programmer happiness.



### [Coders at Work](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219483?ie=UTF8&tag=perplabs-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430219483)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perplabs-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1430219483)



This one is different.  Written as a set of interview transcripts with 15 legendary industry giants, this book is a fantastic insight into how some of the great minds think.  It's inspiring to hear it from the source, must have!



### [Programming Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356336?ie=UTF8&tag=perplabs-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356336)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perplabs-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1934356336)



A developer should learn at least one new language a year.  This year that language should be Clojure.  Clojure is a dynamic, general purpose, language targeting the Java virtual machine and designed for multi-threaded use.  It's growing popularity, ability to leverage the Java standard library, and its multi-threaded nature make this a must have.



### [The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201835959?ie=UTF8&tag=perplabs-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201835959)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perplabs-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0201835959)



Another classic.  Primarily discusses project management from the perspective of Fred Brooks and his experiences at IBM.  Brooks' Law states that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later".



### [Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758?ie=UTF8&tag=perplabs-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321344758)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perplabs-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321344758)



Web developers should always keep in mind the user of the product their creating.  Usability becomes increasingly important as applications move to the web.  The design and usability of your app can make or break its success.  This classic is a must read.



### [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612?ie=UTF8&tag=perplabs-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201633612)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perplabs-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0201633612)
