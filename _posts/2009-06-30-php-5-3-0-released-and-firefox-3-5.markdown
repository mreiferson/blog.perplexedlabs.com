Pretty major day in the world of the web, eh?

The PHP development team announced the [release of version 5.3.0](http://php.net/releases/5_3_0.php).  This is a **major** milestone.  Here's what I'm most excited about:




	
  * Lambda Functions and Closures

	
  * ternary short cut "?:"

	
  * Optional garbage collection for cyclic references



I'm excited about support for namespaces, but not the particular syntactical implementation chosen.

Also, the Mozilla team announced the official release of [Firefox 3.5](http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-3.5&os=win&lang=en-US).  Firefox is my browser of choice thanks to the great web development plugins available for it such as:




	
  * [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)

	
  * [HttpFox](http://code.google.com/p/httpfox/)

	
  * [Web Developer Toolbar](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/)


Version 3.5 looks to make an already excellent browser even faster.
